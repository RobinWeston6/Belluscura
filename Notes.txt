V2

1. Change functionality of SN Collection 
    - PK SKU, Entry No.
    - put sn collection processing into loops

2. Labels should print for all items with Serial No in parent item or component
    - Loop through the BOM to create (new tyoe) SN Collection records per BOM line
    - Possibly print label when SNcollection count filtered to SKU = total BOM line quantities (on Post)
    NEW PLAN
    - Print label on Post
    - print all serial no from table with matching SKU
    - Insert new sn collection entry on validate of item tracking lines from Assembly Orders
        - single instance codeunit event
        - will need to generate SKU first
        - print label on post - last opportunity to filter to assembly header no.

3. VERY IMPORTANT - MIGRATE SNcollection DATA TO NEW SNCOLLECTIONENTRY TABLE

X. Simplify report
    - dynamic resizing
    - extra level of grouping

Y. Print report on Post
    - will need to find a way to default in SKU rather than scanning

Z. Find way to simplify SN validation on Item Tracking Lines - slowing down with large batches


************************************************************
1. Reduce button clicks on assembly order
    - One item at a time
    - Dwayne does first header
    - copy first header per item made, delete ass ord on close pages
    DEFAULTS
        x- CHOOSE bins
        x- Due Date - OnNewRecord
        x- Location - Plano - Setup
            - Lines - will default in from header but uses pop-up - default this to yes and do nont show
        - Qty - 1 - set onaftervalidate item no
        - productline Code (Shortcut Dim 1) - comes from item - onaftervalidate item no
    ITEM TRACKING
        - Open item tracking page automatically per line
            - only if
                Line.Type = Item
                Item.Item Tracking Code = SERIAL

    - GLB serial non collection - fill in based on item tracking Lines

    - generate sku
    - print the label
    - open header item tracking
    - scan sku
    - Post
                
2. Remove buttons on all pages
3. Dwayne's Role (check all okay)
4. Inv by bins report/factbox
5. Aged Pay/Rec Excel Export
    - More difficult than we think - Excel Export
    - Check which codeunit produces the export
